= wiki_books

This plugin allows the user to define a book index of wiki pages and navigate through the book.
Each project has its own books based on wiki pages.  
Each book contains chapters.  
Each chapter is a link to a wiki page and has a sorting order value (a float) and a chapter numbering (an string).
The numbering is shown in the book index, preceding each chapter.  Some examples are: 1.2, 3.a), etc.
The sorting order allows the user to control the chapter order.

The wiki books permission for editing and managing the books is based in the plugin permission system.
The recommended permissions are:
* Manager role: view books, manage books, view book chapters.
